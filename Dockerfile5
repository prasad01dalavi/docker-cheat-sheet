# Now lets use the centos as a build and get the contents of it
FROM alpine

# Lets copy the jar file(5MB) of centos to the alpine
COPY --from=build /opt/jar /jarfile.jar

# Now, The image size will be alpine image + 5 MB 
# Here we used the centos image for building our multi-stage image
# But we made the iamge size way lesser than the centos 
# by using centos as a build for multi-staging
